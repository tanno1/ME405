This allows for a more reasonable step size while maintaining the reasonable accuracy of the solution. The algoritihm is similar to Euler's method, however it splits the window of time, $\\Delta t$ in half, and computes the derivative several times at the start of the time window, in the middle, and at the end. These derivatives are used to find a weighted average which is the used in a standard Euler step. \n",
