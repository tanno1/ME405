## <u>Overview</u>
This repository contains all of the work I completed for ME 405 - Mechatronics at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The main attraction here is the term project, called Girlfriend #2, named accordingly because of the immense time requirement that was put into the project. Please see the term project folder in the files for a much more detailed explanation of the project, but in short, Girlfriend #2 was a line following robot designed to follow a course designed specifically for the term project competition. Our design emphasized simplicity and minimalism, as we discovered through watching other teams, that complexity in mechatronics projects is not always necessary and there are other ways to solve issues than to "throw more hardware at it".
